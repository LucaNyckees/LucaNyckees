Hey there, I'm Luca. :basecampy:

I studied **mathematics at EPFL**, and during the master I transitioned from pure mathematics to AI/ML and data science research and applications. 

I have worked for **4+ years in the machine learning sector**, from making research around topological machine learning in the Laboratory of Neuroscience under Prof. Kathryn Hess to building end-to-end systems with a full machine learning code stack at **Expedia Group** in a highly skilled team, including a startup experience at Quanthome, where I led a team of 4, as data scientist and head of machine learning operations.
