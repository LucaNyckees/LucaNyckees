Hey there, I'm Luca. :basecampy:

I am a data scientist and data engineer. My professional experience spans over **4+ years**, having worked for the past 2 years as data scientist and machine learning operations engineer at Quanthome in Lausanne.

I am used to supervise juniors, lead **machine learning engineering** projects (building and deploying models), work on database management projects and have solid experience with **MLOps** and DevOps duties.

I studied **mathematics at EPFL**, focusing on statistical and topological data analysis, and machine learning engineering. In parallel to my studies, I worked part-time for 2 years in the Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience at EPFL on data science projects.
